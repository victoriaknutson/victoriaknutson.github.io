Hello! I am a third year PhD student in the Biostatistics Department. I am a 2020 graduate from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. Currently I am working on research under Dr. Jon Wakefield on the creation and implementation of a modeling framework incorporating different types of global mortality data, with varying patterns of missingness and temporal granularity, toward the estimation of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period of 2020-2021. This research has the aim of producing excess death estimates for the World Health Organization. We are currently investigating methodologies for producing the expected mortality estimates, data completeness estimates, country-specific covariate imputation, and age-sex population disaggregation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing ultimate frisbee.
