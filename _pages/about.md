Hello! I am a fifth year PhD student at the University of Washington Department of Biostatistics. I am a 2020 graduate from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. Currently I am working on research under Dr. Jon Wakefield on the creation and implementation of a modeling framework incorporating different types of global mortality data, with varying patterns of missingness and temporal granularity, toward the estimation of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic period of 2020-2022. This research has the aim of producing excess death estimates for the World Health Organization. We are currently investigating methodologies for producing the expected mortality estimates, vital registration data completeness estimates, country-specific covariate imputation, and age-sex population disaggregation.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing ultimate frisbee.
