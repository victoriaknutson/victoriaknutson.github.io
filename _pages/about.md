Hello! I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at University of Washington working with the Gates Foundation under advisement of Dr. Jon Wakefield on the development of statistical methods for global health and mortality estimation, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Washington in 2025 and am a 2020 graduate of St. Olaf College, where I majored in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics.

My research centers on Bayesian hierarchical modeling, small area estimation, and demographic methods for estimating mortality and health indicators from incomplete and heterogeneous data sources, including vital registration systems and household surveys. I previously served as a research consultant with the World Health Organization, where I worked with the WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Excess Mortality Estimation to develop and implement global excess mortality models.

In addition to mortality modeling, I have experience in spatial epidemiology, environmental health, clinical trial analysis, and open-source software development, including work on R packages and Shiny applications that enable non-statisticians to generate subnational health estimates for policy use.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and playing ultimate frisbee.
